# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection challenge

This project developed as a university project with a teammate.
Deep convolutional neural networks were built and trained, trying to predict diabetic retinopathy within images of the human eye.

The data was preprocessed and augmented.
A hyperparameter grid search was performed in order to built a non-overfitting well performing model.
The results were visualized with Grad-CAM.
